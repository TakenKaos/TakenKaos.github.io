    <p class="intro">
        Hello, my name is Alex Cacciacarro. Today I am going to be explaining the difference between 2 stroke and 4
        stroke dirtbikes.
        I will cover the differences between the two, as well as which one I prefer.
    </p>
    <p>here are webpages that cover the basics</p>

    <h2 class="headings">How they work, 2 strokes</h2>
    <p class="main-text">Unlike 4 strokes, the 2 stroke engine does not have valves.
        This contributes to their lighter weight. The two
        stroke engine fires (produces power) once every revolution of the crankshaft.
        Whereas a four stroke fires once
        every other revolution. To break it down further for youâ€¦
        every time the piston rises in the combustion chamber,
        it fills with a carefully balanced combination of air, petrol and oil. This is compressed and then ignited by
        the spark plug, causing an explosion which forces the piston back down. This process repeats. Two strokes of the
        piston for every one ignition. A compression stroke, and a combustion stroke.
        PROS: lots of power and great at low speed movement
        CONS: inconsistant power</p>

    <h2 class="headings"> How they work, 4 strokes</h2>
    <p class="main-text">The first movement is the intake stroke.
        As the piston moves from the top of the cylinder block to the bottom,
        the intake valve/s open to allow a mixture of fuel and air to be drawn in to the cylinder.
        The second movement is the compression stroke. All valves are closed as the piston rises, causing the fuel mix
        to be compressed.
        As the piston reaches the top of its stroke, the compressed fuel mix is ignited by the spark plug, causing an
        explosion which forces the piston back down. This is the combustion stroke.
        Now the piston begins to rise again. The exhaust valve opens up and releases the emissions from within the
        cylinder, out through the exhaust pipe. This is the exhaust stroke.
        PROS: Consistant power and a smooth ride
        CONS: overheats easily at slow speeds</p>

    <h2 class="headings">Which one I prefer</h2>
    <p class="main-text">Personally I really like both and can't choose a favourite. 2 strokes are really jumpy and fun
        and make a cool high pitch noise that keeps you wanting more.
        4 strokes make a deep noise and give you consistant controllable power. Both are great in their own rights and
        owning both would be ideal to me. At the end of the day all that really matters is that you are having fun.
        weather you drive a 2 stroke or a 4 stroke all dirtbikers can agree that its more about the rider than the bike.
